- **Water Feature**: Reflective river running through the forest
- **Geology**: Scattered rocks and boulders for natural variation
- **Wildlife**: Animated deer and rabbits with AI movement patterns
- **Avian Life**: Flying birds with circular flight patterns
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Fog, dust particles, and dynamic sky colors

### Technical Implementation
- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient geometry and material usage
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6 modules and modern browser APIs

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Scene Management**: Three.js scene with proper hierarchy
- **Lighting System**: Directional lights for sun/moon with ambient lighting
- **Material System**: PBR materials with realistic roughness and metalness
- **Animation Loop**: 60fps rendering with delta time calculations
- **Camera System**: Perspective camera with orbit controls

### Key Classes and Functions
- `createPineTree()`: Procedural tree generation with multiple canopy layers
- `createDeer()` / `createRabbit()`: Animal mesh generation
- `animate()`: Main rendering loop with day-night cycle
- Lighting calculations for realistic sun/moon positioning

## 🌅 Day-Night Cycle

The environment features a complete 40-second day-night cycle with:
- **Sun Movement**: Arc trajectory across the sky
- **Moon Movement**: Opposite phase to the sun
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Intensity changes based on celestial position
- **Atmospheric Changes**: Background color transitions
- **Particle Effects**: Dust motes visible during day, stars at night
- **Fog Adaptation**: Fog color matches sky color

## 🎨 Visual Features
